Putting the R in Sports
=======================
This is the repo from my Devopsdays presentation.
-------------------------------------------------

You need to have R installed on your computer. 

The basic commands used in the presentation are in **CheatSheet.MD**

**Batting.csv** and **Salaries.csv** are from the [Lahmanâ€™s Baseball Database](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/())

The **Dockerfile** file will build a Docker image with R and the complete Lahman database installed. 

Here is a link to the Slide Deck version of the presentation
